# What this does:
# For $distro-list in $incoming-dir, add files found to a Debian repo via the magic of reprepro.
# Then, as is our wont, emit a message to that effect on future.packages.updates and a different
# message for eventbot on future.events.repository.
#
# Why?
# Say you've a job that builds a package. Emitting that package to the repo and having it add
# it to the catalogue automatically is just jenkins + scp (+ cron). You may have further jobs
# that can be kicked off when that package is updated. They can monitor the future.events.repository
# topic and take appropriate action.
#
# Topics:
report-topic: future.events.repository
package-topic: future.package.updates
