Usage:

git-configure::site{ "spog": site => "www.spog.com", repo => "spog", rootdir => "/data" }

Where the name is, um, the name, site is the name of the directory under the rootdir,
and repo is the name of the git repository.

Most of the time you won't need to change the rootdir since it defaults to data.

As part of the setup, it installs a perl daemon called stomp-git, which waits for
traffic about (repo) on future.git.commits. The repo and site-dir are written into
the YAML config file (/etc/stomp-git/stomp-git.yaml) by the puppet code.

Patches welcome.
