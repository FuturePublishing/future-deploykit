# Puppetmaster mode

# This is a version of this thing:

# ... That works over AMQ. 
#
# WTF? 
# We have mutiple domains that are comprehensively firewalled and wanted to 
# drive them all from the same git-based puppetmaster tree. Thus multiple 
# puppetmasters running in sync. It's up to the reader to determine if they
# prefer wonky shell-and-ssh magic or this sort of nadgery.
#
# How this works: cd into relatively standard puppetmaster tree.
# Clone your git-based PM tree. Ours is called 'puppet-environments' such that it goes
# /etc/puppet/puppet-environments/modules, ../manifests and ../.git
# 
# Softlink 'master' to 'production' (or whatever your standard environment is called)
#
# Configure your environments in puppet.conf like this:
# manifest = $confdir/environments/$environment/manifests/site.pp
#
# Uncomment/configure the/a relevant repo-type
#
# Profit!
#
# All repo modes badly explained:
# normal: - fetch $repo.
# trusting - fetch $repo, checkout origin/master to $target.
# dangerous - fetch $repo, checkout origin/master.
# puppetmaster - fetch $repo, checkout to $target/$branch. As above.
